# Frontend Implementation Plan

## High-Level Goal
Build a responsive React-based interface for the Monthly Budget Tracker that reflects the cultural fusion wireframes provided in `design/wireframes.md`.

## Subtasks
1. **Project Setup**
   - Scaffold a Vite + React application with routing and shared styling utilities.
   - Configure base theme variables (colors, typography, spacing) reflecting Mexican and Italian influences.

2. **Global Layout & Navigation**
   - Implement the primary navigation shell (top navigation, language toggle, profile chips).
   - Ensure responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

3. **Authentication Screen**
   - Create the hero split background with welcome messaging and login card.
   - Style bilingual text elements and language pill interactions.

4. **Dashboard Experience**
   - Build KPI strip and layout columns.
   - Integrate placeholder charts (donut, bar, timeline) with cultural theming.
   - Implement reusable cards (Cultural Spotlight, Quick Add, Transaction timeline).

5. **Modals & Forms**
   - Create Add Income/Expense modal with bilingual tabs and cultural slider accents.
   - Apply accessible form styling and focus states.

6. **Category Management Page**
   - Implement filter sidebar and responsive table/cards for category listings.
   - Support inline add/edit interactions with animated transitions (CSS-based for now).

7. **Reports Page**
   - Build filter bar and dual-column layout with chart placeholders and summary table.
   - Provide export button group with language confirmation prompt.

8. **Interactions & Responsiveness Polish**
   - Add hover/focus states, gradient animations, and iconography cues.
   - Validate responsive stacking behavior for tablet/mobile.

## Guidelines
- **Design Fidelity:** Use CSS gradients, background images, and decorative SVGs to evoke papel picado, terrazzo, and other motifs.
- **Typography:** Pair a bold sans-serif for headings (e.g., Montserrat Alternates or system fallback) with a warm serif (e.g., Lora). Define CSS variables for these fonts and include fallbacks.
- **Color Palette:** Define theme tokens for Fiesta Red, Sunrise Yellow, Cactus Green, Terracotta, Tuscan Olive, and Mediterranean Navy. Apply gradients blending Mexican warm tones with Italian earthy hues.
- **Accessibility:** Maintain 4.5:1 contrast, provide focus outlines, and use `aria` attributes for bilingual toggles and cultural icon descriptions.
- **Components Reuse:** Centralize shared UI primitives (buttons, cards, chips) to ensure consistent styling across pages.
- **Data Handling:** Use mocked data structures for charts and tables to demonstrate layout without backend integration.
- **Responsive Strategy:** Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox breakpoints at 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px to progressively adapt layouts.
- **Animation & Delight:** Use subtle transitions (0.2sâ€“0.3s) and keyframe animations for hover effects like confetti or ribbon underline.

Following these guidelines ensures the build remains organized, thematically consistent, and ready for future integration work.
